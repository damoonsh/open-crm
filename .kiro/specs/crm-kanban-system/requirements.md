# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a CRM system that supports workspace-based kanban boards with ticket management, commenting functionality, and task dependencies. The system will provide a minimal but complete data model for managing tickets across different workspaces with category-based organization and inter-ticket relationships.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create and manage workspaces so that I can organize my projects and teams separately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a workspace THEN the system SHALL store the workspace with a unique identifier and name
2. WHEN a user views their workspaces THEN the system SHALL display all workspaces they have access to
3. WHEN a user deletes a workspace THEN the system SHALL remove the workspace and all associated tickets
4. IF a user has appropriate permissions THEN the system SHALL allow workspace creation and modification

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create and manage tickets within workspaces so that I can track tasks and issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a ticket THEN the system SHALL assign it to a specific workspace and category
2. WHEN a user updates a ticket THEN the system SHALL save the changes and maintain audit trail
3. WHEN a user moves a ticket between categories THEN the system SHALL update the ticket's category status
4. WHEN a user views tickets THEN the system SHALL display them organized by category in kanban format
5. IF a ticket has dependencies THEN the system SHALL display dependency relationships

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to move tickets between different categories within a workspace so that I can track progress through my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user drags a ticket to a different category THEN the system SHALL update the ticket's category
2. WHEN a ticket is moved THEN the system SHALL validate the move is allowed based on dependencies
3. WHEN a ticket move is completed THEN the system SHALL update the kanban board display
4. IF a ticket has blocking dependencies THEN the system SHALL prevent invalid status transitions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add comments to tickets so that I can communicate with team members about specific tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user adds a comment to a ticket THEN the system SHALL store the comment with timestamp and author
2. WHEN a user replies to a comment THEN the system SHALL create a threaded comment structure
3. WHEN a user views a ticket THEN the system SHALL display all comments in chronological order
4. WHEN a user deletes their own comment THEN the system SHALL remove the comment from the thread

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to set dependencies between tickets so that I can manage task relationships and workflow constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a dependency THEN the system SHALL link the dependent ticket to one or more blocking tickets
2. WHEN a user views a ticket THEN the system SHALL display all tickets it depends on and tickets that depend on it
3. WHEN a blocking ticket is completed THEN the system SHALL update the dependent ticket's status availability
4. IF creating a dependency would create a circular reference THEN the system SHALL prevent the dependency creation
5. WHEN a user removes a dependency THEN the system SHALL update both tickets' dependency relationships

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to move tickets between different workspaces so that I can reorganize work across projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user moves a ticket to another workspace THEN the system SHALL update the ticket's workspace assignment
2. WHEN a ticket is moved between workspaces THEN the system SHALL preserve the ticket's comments and dependencies
3. WHEN a ticket with dependencies is moved THEN the system SHALL handle cross-workspace dependency relationships
4. IF a user lacks permission to the target workspace THEN the system SHALL prevent the ticket move
5. WHEN a ticket move is completed THEN the system SHALL update both source and target workspace displays

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a REST API for all ticket operations so that external systems can integrate with the CRM.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API request is made THEN the system SHALL authenticate and authorize the request
2. WHEN creating tickets via API THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields and relationships
3. WHEN updating tickets via API THEN the system SHALL apply the same business rules as the UI
4. WHEN querying tickets via API THEN the system SHALL return data in a consistent JSON format
5. IF an API operation fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate and have appropriate permissions so that I can securely access my workspaces and tickets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL verify their credentials and create a session
2. WHEN a user accesses a workspace THEN the system SHALL verify they have appropriate permissions
3. WHEN a user performs an action THEN the system SHALL check their role-based permissions
4. IF a user lacks permission THEN the system SHALL deny access and return an appropriate error
5. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate their session
